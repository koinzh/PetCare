# Introduction
<!--We are one group students at the University of Glasgow. This project is the course design of our real-time embedded system. In this course, we are the team 21. We find that when pets-owners leave home for a long time, feeding pets is a big problem. So we decide to make one automatic pet feeder to help that people to feed their pets when they are busy. Basically, using raspberry PI to make an automatic feeder, real-time monitoring of pet movement and food weight. RealizeÂ intelligent feeding, protect the health of pets. -->

# Equipment
<!--
* Raspberry Pi 3B+ 
* Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
* Weight sensor (HX711)
* Step motor (28BYJ-48)
* Paperboard  
* Large plastic bottle
* Bowl

# Object
<!--
* Ultrasonic sensors detect the distance from the pet, and the feeder starts working when the pet approaches.
* The weight sensor detects the weight of the food in the bowl. When the weight of food < 10g, starts the motor to make the baffle turn to replenish food. When the weight of food > 50g, the motor rotates backward.

* Limiting conditions:  
   1.There will be a 4h cooldown time after feeding is first turned on.  
   2.The machine can only add the food for three times within 24 hours.
